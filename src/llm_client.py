      have no prefix. Deleted lines are not included.
    * An XML context block is provided for each changed file, containing
      either:

      - ``<adaptive_diff file="...">`` — N lines of context around the
        changed lines when Tree-sitter is unavailable or the language is
        not supported.

    * Line numbers inside the XML blocks are **1-based absolute** line
      numbers from the new version of the file and should be used as the
      authoritative reference when reporting issue positions.
    * The review must focus **exclusively** on the changed lines (``+`` in
      the ``<diff>`` block); the XML context blocks exist only for
      structural understanding.

    For ``full_code`` scope, the instructions inform the LLM that the diff
